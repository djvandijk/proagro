	<title>How to make a hand pump</title>
	<description>This technical manual provides detailed instructions on how to make a submerged hand pump, using PVC pipes, old tyres and wood. The model described functions to a depth of 24 m. Its low cost means it is highly affordable, and the materials used to make it can be easily founded. Maintenance is relatively simple, and the extended handle means that the pumping action significantly reduces the effort required by users. In addition, the hand pump reduces risks of water contamination and accidents (falls), especially in areas where water is drawn with a bucket and rope.</description>
