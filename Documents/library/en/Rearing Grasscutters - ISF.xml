	<title>Rearing Grasscutters</title>
	<description>This manual is extension material for unconventional animal breeding. It describes how to rear grasscutters, large rodents that are commonly found in the wild in areas of grassland, clearing, wet or marshy areas in Africa. Grasscutters breed prolifically, grow quickly and are easy to rear, thereby making them an ideal alternative to patching for meat. The manual highlights the agricultural value of grasscutters by-products unfit for human consumption.</description>
